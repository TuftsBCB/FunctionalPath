<Evalution using functional paths>

* Usage:

-> ./run [path_to_directory_containing_ predictionfiles] [path_to_known_annotation_file] [path_to_functional_path_file]
-> i.e., ./run ./prediction_results/DSDunweighted/ ./prediction_results/trueannotations.list ./functional_path/BP.path

1) Place a folder that contains prediction result files in "prediction_results".
2) Path to output files: evaluation_results.
3) For example, if you execute "./run ./prediction_results/DSDunweighted/ ./prediction_results/trueannotations.list ./functional_path/BP.path", you can find output files in ./evaluation_results/DSDunweighted/.



* Format of input file
- Each GO term should be delimited by tab ("\t").
- In prediction set, there is no space between function (GO term) and the score bracket.
-> i.e., (for true annotation) YGR140W   GO:0006996   GO:0007049   GO:0022402
-> i.e., (for prediction) YGR140W   GO:0006996(12)   GO:0043170(12)   GO:0050794(5)   GO:0044260(2)   GO:0051716(1)   GO:0007049(1)   GO:1901360(1)   GO:1901576(1)   GO:0006468(1)
          This example was grabbed from GMC results.



* Format of output file

1) Name of output file: the output file will have the same name as input file except for the extension.
	*.count -> evaluation results using counting method
	*.depth -> evaluation results using depth of shared node

2) In each file, 
	the first line is averaged precision and recall.
	from the second line:
		[protein] [precision] [recall]
